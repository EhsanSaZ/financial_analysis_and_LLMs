Good morning.
Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is damaging Russia’s economy, driving up domestic consumer prices and forcing Moscow to spend a third of its budget on defence, the US Treasury department has said.
Rachel Lyngaas, the department’s chief sanctions economist, said the combination of war, US allies’ sanctions and Moscow’s policy response was “putting Russia’s economy under considerable economic strain”.
The comments appeared in a draft text, seen by the Financial Times, of one of the most comprehensive assessments of the financial consequences for Russia of the president’s decision to send troops into Ukraine last year.
Russia’s invasion and occupation of parts of Ukraine were now “contributing to rapidly growing expenditures, a depreciating rouble, increasing inflation, and a tight labour market reflecting a loss of workers” in its economy, Lyngaas wrote.
Russia’s economy would be more than 5 per cent bigger if Putin had not launched the war in Ukraine, Lyngaas argued, adding that the country was underperforming other energy exporters, including the US. Read the full exclusive story.

2. The UK has been chosen as the headquarters to build a new fighter jet with Italy and Japan, as the three nations push forward ambitious plans to have the aircraft flying by 2035. The plans for the Global Combat Air Programme were confirmed in a trilateral treaty signed in Tokyo today. Here are more details on the ambitious initiative.
3. The US House of Representatives has voted to approve an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden, with 221 Republicans supporting the move and 212 Democrats against. The inquiry is based on allegations that Biden improperly benefited from his son Hunter’s business dealings, though no evidence has emerged of wrongdoing by the president. Here’s how the Bidens have responded.
4. Homelessness and rough sleeping have risen sharply in England, driven by the cost of living crisis and housing shortage. New research shows the number of people who will spend Christmas without a home has jumped by 14 per cent year on year to 309,000, with nearly half of them children. Here are more findings from advocacy group Shelter.
5. BP said its former chief executive Bernard Looney would forfeit up to £32.4mn over “serious misconduct” related to failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Looney stepped down abruptly in September after he admitted to not being “fully transparent” with the board. But BP said yesterday it had determined Looney knowingly misled the board and the oil major had therefore decided to sack him without notice.

Almost 200 countries yesterday signed an agreement at COP28 to transition from fossil fuels. Talks over the deal, which pushed the world’s most important climate summit almost 24 hours beyond its deadline, exposed deep divisions between wealthy and poorer countries over the costs of halting new coal, oil and gas projects. While a compromise has been won, the battle for a 1.5C limit may have been lost.
