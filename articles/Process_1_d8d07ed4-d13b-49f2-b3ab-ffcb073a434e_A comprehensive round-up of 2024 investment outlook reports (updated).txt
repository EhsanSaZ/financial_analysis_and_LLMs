If you’ve been unfortunate enough to have spent some time on LinkedIn in recent weeks you will have noticed a flurry of investment research posting from earnest hustle merchants.
Alphaville’s love and affection for our readers knows no limits, so as a special service to you this Christmas we have once again been collecting our own sellside and buyside word salads 2024 outlooks, to save you from having to brave the humblebrag jungles. Update: we’ve now added more than a dozen new 2024 reports at the bottom.
Where possible we’ve added links to public reports; elsewhere they are either embedded or direct-link PDFs. In almost all cases these are reports that are already widely circulating online, but if you are an irate head of research somewhere that wants us to take something down then send us an email. If you are an irate head of research who wants your opus magnum included then you can also email us.
To differentiate Alphaville from all those other lazy research round-up posts, we’ve this year adorned our links with some random words.
It should be noted that some of the predictions are already hilariously out of date, after the Federal Reserve last week pencilled in three interest rate cuts next year. Which says something about the transitory, futile nature of annual outlooks that no one will remember by the time November 2024 comes around.
And if that wasn’t enough to take all this with a pinch of salt, remember that this time last year 85 per cent of economists thought we’d be in a recession by now.
Anyway, on to the 2024 research dump!
